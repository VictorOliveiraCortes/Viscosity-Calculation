# Viscosity-Calculation

## Goal:

Implementation of a viscosity calculation method to calculate the viscosity of Deep eutectic solvent systems (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_eutectic_solvent) using:

- data obtained from [GROMACS] (http://www.gromacs.org/) of molecular dynamics simulations of a chemical system composed of sodium dodecanoate and decanoic acid;
- and the Maginn Methodology presented in the article * Reliable Viscosity Calculation from Molecular Equilibrium Dynamics Simulations: A Time Decomposition Method (DOI: 10.1021 / acs.jctc.5b00351) * to calculate the viscosity of simulated systems.

### Note:

This work was carried out in collaboration with Mariana Hoyer Moreira, as part of her Dissertation Thesis.
